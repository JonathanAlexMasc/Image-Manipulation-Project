# Image-Manipulation-Project

Welcome! This project was built in C++ and is able to maniulate images in all sorts of ways. Below is a list of all the different operations that the program can perform on an image. 

* Rotate Clockwise
* Rotate CounterClockwise
* Flip on the X-axis 
* Flip on the Y-axis
* Convert to Grayscale
* Convert to Sepia

More than one operation from the above can be performed on an image. Image files are either of the .ppm or .pgm type.
